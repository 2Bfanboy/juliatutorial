# [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl)

JuMP is an algebric modelling language for mathematical optimisation problems, similar to GAMS, AMPL or Pyomo.

It is solver-independent, supporting also non-linear solvers and providing them with the Gradient and the Hessian. Fast

The following notebook provides a commented implementation in JuMP of the classical transport problem found in the GAMS tutorial:
