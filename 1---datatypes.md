# Datatypes

## Scalar types

An unusual feature of Julia is that it allows variable names to include a subset of Unicode symbols, allowing a variable to be represented e.g. by a greek letter.

In most Julia development environments (including the console), to input in the script the greek letter you can use a LaTeX-like syntax, typing `\` and then the LaTeX name for the symbol, e.g. `\alpha` for `Î±`.
Using LaTeX syntax, you can also add subscripts, superscripts and decorators.

The main types of scalar you will use are `Int64`, `Float64`, `Char` (e.g. `x = 'a'`), `String` (e.g. `x="abc"`) and `Bool`.
The default if you do not specify is Float64. Attenction to use the single quote for chars and double quotes for strings.

Also, while boolean values `true` and `false` are evaluated to `1` and `0` respectively, the opposite is not true. So, ` if 0 [...] end` brings an error. 

## Strings

Typical string operations are supported:
`split(s)` _(default on whitespaces)_, `replace(s, "toSearch", "toReplace")` and strip(s) _(remove whitespaces)_

### Concatenation

There are several ways to concatenate strings:
* Concatenation operator: `*`;
* Function `string(str1,str2,str3)`;
* Combine string variables in a bigger one using the dollar symbol: `a = "$str1 is a string and $(myobject.int1) is an integer"` ("interpolation")

The first method doesn't authomatically cast integer and floats to strings.


## Arrays \(lists\)

Empty (zero-elements) arrays: `a = []` (or `a = Int64[]`)

5-elements zeros array: `a=zeros(5)` (or a=`zeros(Int64,5)`) (same with `ones()`)

Column vector (_Vector_ container, most common) : `a = [1;2;3]` or `a=[1,2,3]`

Row vector (_Matrix_ container, less common) : `a = [1 2 3]`

Reference to an element of an array/vector/matrix: `a[1]` (you can use also the keyword `end`, but not `begin`)

Arrays can be heterogeneus (but in this case the array will be of `Any` type): `x = [10, "foo", false]`

Slice syntax [from:step:to] is generally supported and in several context will return a (fast) iterator rather than a list.

To trasform an iterator in a list use `collect(myiterator)`

Push an element to the end of a: `push!(a,b)`

To append the elements of b to a: `append!(a,b)`
(if b is a scalar obviously push! and append! are the same)

Remove an element from the end: `pop!(a)`

Add an element at the beginning (left): `unshift!(a,1)`

Removing an element at the beginning (left) : `shift!(a)`

Sorting: `sort!(a)` or `sort(a)` (depending if we want modify or not the original array)

Reversing an arry: `a[end:-1:1]`

Checking for existence: `in(1, a)`

Getting the length: `length(a)`

## Turples

Use turples to have a list of immutable elements: `a = (1,2,3)` or even without parenthesis `a = 1,2,3`

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries store mappings from keys to values. They have an apparently random sorting.

Empty (zero-elements) dictionary: `mydict = Dict()`

Initialize a dictionary with values: `mydict = Dict('a'=>1, 'b'=>2, 'c'=>3)`

Look up values: `mydict['a']` (it raises an error if looked-up value doesn't exist)

Look up value with a default value for non-existing key: `get(mydict,'a',0)`

Get all keys: `keys(mydict)` (the result is an iterator, not a list)
Get all values: `values(mydict)` (result is again an iterator)

Check if a key exists: `haskey(mydict, 'a')`

Check if a given key/value pair exists (that it, if the key exists and has that specific value): `in(('a' => 1), mydict)`

Iterate trough a dictionary:

```
for (k,v) in mydict
   println("$k is $v")
end
```

## Sets

Use Sets to represent collections of unordered, unique values

Empty (zero-elements) set: `a = Set()`

Initialize a set with values: `a = Set([1,2,2,3,4])`

Set intersection, union, and difference: `intersect(set1,set2)`, `union(set1,set2)`, `setdiff(set1,set2)`
