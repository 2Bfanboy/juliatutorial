# Julia language: a concise tutorial
![](/assets/julia_hello_world.png)

While the primary purpose of this tutorial is to help myself in my pathway of learning the language, it can also be useful to reasonably seasoned programmers that want to code in Julia before reading the 533 pages of the (outstanding) [official documentation](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.5/).

This document is a compendium of thinks I did found of interest from several tutorials (plus the official documentation), in particular Chris Rackauckas's [A Deep Introduction to Julia](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/)
 and the [Quantecon tutorial](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/learning_julia.html), from which I did borrow several examples.

The focus is on Julia as a generic programming language rather than on domain-specific issues. The format is in the middle between a classical tutorial and a cheatsheet: the exposition analyses the elements of the language following the typical sections of a programming language tutorial (_data types, control flows, functions.._), but the information is given in a pretty concise way, suitable for people that already know the concepts implemented in an other programming language (e.g. we don't go explaining what a `for` loop does, but we write how to implement it in Julia).

English is not my primary language, so please be understanding and report me of any errors, both in the language or in the content.

Happy coding with Julia !
