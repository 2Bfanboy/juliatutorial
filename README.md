# juliatutorial
A concise tutorial for the Julia language. Mainly for myself to keep things I learned.

This is a compendium of thinks I did found of interest for me from several tutorials (plus the official documentation), in particular Chris Rackauckas's [A Deep Introduction to Julia](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/)
 and the [Quantecon tutorial](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/learning_julia.html), from which I did borrow several examples.

The focus is on Julia as a generic programming language rather than domain-specific issues, and while a regardable quantity of information is present, it is exposed pretty concisely, having in mind someone with alread a background in programming.
