## Scalar variables ##
An unusual feature of Julia is that it allows variable names to include a subset of Unicode symbols, allowing a variable to be represented e.g. by a greek letter.

In most Julia development environments (including the console), to input in the script the greek letter you can use a LaTeX-like syntax, typing `\` and then the LaTeX name for the symbol, e.g. `\alpha` for Î±.
Using LaTeX syntax, you can also add subscripts, superscripts and decorators.
